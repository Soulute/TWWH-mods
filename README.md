Mods for Total War: Warhammer game series.

Welcome to my TWWH-mods github! It's a repository for my mods for the Total War: Warhammer videogame series.


It is divided into 4 sections:

* **[Better_Sieges_family](https://github.com/Soulute/TWWH-mods/tree/main/Better_Sieges_family)** for anything and everything related to siege battles. Pierce's Better Sieges and Reporting For Duty are here.

* **[new_units_and_heroes](https://github.com/Soulute/TWWH-mods/tree/main/new_units_and_heroes)** for any new units or heroes. Lthelis Elven Lords is here.

* **[rules_tweaks_and_fixes](https://github.com/Soulute/TWWH-mods/tree/main/rules_tweaks_and_fixes)** for mods that change the game rules. Glorious Charges and Roguier Rogues are here.

* **[more_content](https://github.com/Soulute/TWWH-mods/tree/main/more_content)** for other content mods, including Pirates of the Seas and OMFG THE ZOMBIES!!!

These mods are saved as packfiles (.pack) which store db tables, textures, and scripts. To view the packfiles, I recommend using Frodo's [Rusted File Pack Manager](https://github.com/Frodo45127/rpfm). For my mods that use scripts, I've also extracted their scripts into the repo.
